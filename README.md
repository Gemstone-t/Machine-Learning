# Machine Learning Project

This project is a testing Machine Learning project aimed at exploring and experimenting with various Machine Learning concepts and techniques.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

---

### 1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

To isolate dependencies, create a virtual environment in the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### 2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

- **Windows**

```bash
python -m venv env
```

- **Mac/Linux:**

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Run the Project**

Start the project by running the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed before proceeding.
Use the virtual environment for all development to avoid dependency conflicts.
Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
